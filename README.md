## Questions
How do characters move and interact throughout Game of Thrones?

## TODOs
- bug - pin colors
- Add episode description
- way to explore character without going through location
- zoom details? - show character images if zoomed in close enough
- Add tick marks to timeline (to help with differentiating between episode scrubbing and scene scrubbing)
- move back button?

- ~~Backend - on initialization - get all episodes w/ locations to have in front-end~~
- ~~Backend - call for location by season/episode~~
- ~~Backend - call for character by season/episode~~
- ~~Backend - call for character to get timeline~~
- ~~Backend - provide number of characters at each loc in initial call~~
- ~~scrubbable timeline~~
- ~~turn off highlight for "Unknown" and "Self"~~
- ~~back button in side panel (char page -> loc page)~~
- ~~link backend to frontend~~
- ~~Add character wiki links (in db)~~
- ~~Improve character pictures on location page. Make consistent proportions.~~
- ~~bug - back button does not work at all~~
- ~~Add episode name and wiki link (Name and wiki link done)~~
- ~~selecting character - change locations to diff color? red too subtle?~~
- ~~add leaflet watermark~~
- ~~bug - back button doesn't unhighlight location icons (if char in multiple locations)~~
- ~~indicate number of (major) characters at location?~~
- ~~click on location - side bar pop open~~

## Use Notes
Click on location -> click on character
- scrub timeline -> scrubs through season/episodes as normal
- clicks 'select character' -> scrubs through movements for character

Single character scrubbing
- indicate selected character - picture in right hand top corner?
- show info like which characters they're with
- intra-episode movements?
- animate movements?
- Draw then fade lines to show movement?
- pan map with big movements? (@dany)

## Ideas
- Show where characters are from - could by implemented as a new map, or as a filter (or both?)
- Use bluebike-style pins to show how many people in each location (click/hover for more info)
- add filters: e.g. show where all starks are (bonus idea - render "heaven")


## Final Deliverables
- Interactive Poster: a video or interactive web page in the style of a poster presentation.
- Paper: a 2-4 page paper (not counting references) written in the form of a conference paper submission. The paper should present your goals, related work, a detailed description of your system, and a discussion of your design.
- Project Page: ~~List title~~, ~~team members~~, summary image, ~~abstract~~, link to paper, poster, ~~running instructions for the software and other optional materials~~. Host the page with Github Pages.
- Readme File: In the repository's readme.md, include a breakdown of how the work was split among the group members and a commentary on the project process.
- Code: Push code to OG MIT github
- Application: Update live heroku
