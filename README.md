# Game-of-Thrones-Map

## Questions
How do characters move and interact throughout Game of Thrones?

## MVP for Milestone
1. Get map working (https://blog.patricktriest.com/game-of-thrones-map-node-postgres-redis/)
2. Render pins on map (select characters - limit number)
3. Changes pins by stepping through episodes
4. Hover over location for more info on characters & on location
5. Click on character - what info to show?

Edge case - indicate if character in multiple locations in episode
(idea - "Also at River Run" under pic - have hint icon, on hover flashes other location(s))

## Ideas
- Show where characters are from - could by implemented as a new map, or as a filter (or both?)
- Use bluebike-style pins to show how many people in each location (click/hover for more info)
- add filters: e.g. show where all starks are (bonus idea - render "heaven")
- Animate movement of characters
- Links to wiki everywhere
