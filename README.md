## Questions
How do characters move and interact throughout Game of Thrones?

## TODOs
- ~~Backend - on initialization - get all episodes w/ locations to have in front-end~~
- ~~Backend - call for location by season/episode~~
- ~~Backend - call for character by season/episode~~
- ~~Backend - call for character to get timeline~~
- ~~Backend - provide number of characters at each loc in initial call~~
- ~~scrubbable timeline~~
- ~~turn off highlight for "Unknown" and "Self"~~
- link backend to frontend
- Add episode name, description, (wiki link)
- Add character wiki links (in db)
- back button in side panel (char page -> loc page)
- way to explore character without going through location
- add link to reference code/tutorial
- indicate number of (major) characters at location?
- zoom details? - show character images if zoomed in close enough

## Use Notes
Click on location -> click on character
- scrub timeline -> scrubs through season/episodes as normal
- clicks 'select character' -> scrubs through movements for character

Single character scrubbing
- indicate selected character - picture in right hand top corner?
- show info like which characters they're with
- intra-episode movements?
- animate movements?
- Draw then fade lines to show movement?
- pan map with big movements? (@dany)

## Ideas
- Show where characters are from - could by implemented as a new map, or as a filter (or both?)
- Use bluebike-style pins to show how many people in each location (click/hover for more info)
- add filters: e.g. show where all starks are (bonus idea - render "heaven")
