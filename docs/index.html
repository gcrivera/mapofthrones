  <p>Game of Thrones is a television show with a rich historical and culture backdrop, a slew of complex characters, and a densely woven narrative structure. The majority viewership of the show watches at a surface-level and can often get disoriented by the sheer number of named characters and tangle of castles, towns, and regions. Map of Thrones is a geographic visualization of the world portrayed in Game of Thrones. The visualization allows users to quickly glean information regarding past seasons and episodes as well as explore characters and locations across time and space. Map of Thrones is not meant to replace the level of detail afforded to these characters and location in the television show, but to supplement the show and remind users of storylines they may have forgotten. Additionally, it is our hope this visualization will surpass use as supplementary material by sparking new insights and leading to compelling discussions about the show.</p>
